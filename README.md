YACLib (Yet Another Component Library) web component prototypes in pure ES6 modules.
To be rewritten in TypeScript later.

To use on your page, put a `<script type="importmap"> ... </script>` tag with contents of the file `index.importmap` inside `<head>` tag.

_Below_ the importmap tag add `<script type="module" src=" ... "></script>` tags with the components you want to use.

That's all, you can use the selected components in your html.
